## Graphical (Scratch) Course Planning

The graphical (Scratch) programming course is divided into three stages: Basic, Advanced, and Intermediate. The first two stages each consist of 16 class hours, while the Intermediate course varies in hours based on projects, with the number of projects gradually expanding.

| Stage        | Class Hours | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Basic        | 16 hours    | Understand basic programming knowledge, familiarize with various programming structures and thinking methods, and learn about artificial intelligence and extensions.                      |
| Advanced     | 16 hours    | Learn programming for the Internet of Things and web services, applying networks to solve everyday problems, and develop the ability to solve practical issues using programming thinking. |
| Intermediate | x hours     | Project-based course, with varying hours for each project, focusing on comprehensive problem-solving skills.                                                                               |
